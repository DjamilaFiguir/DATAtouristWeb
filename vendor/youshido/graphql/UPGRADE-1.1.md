# Upgrade to 1.1

 We made important changes to the structure of the GraphQL Schema to be more consistent with the original specification and to be able to implement Relay.

### Processor
 Processor cannot really exist without the Schema, so it was added as a required parameter to constructor:  
 Before:
 ```php
 $processor = new Processor();
 $processor->setSchema(new Schema([
     'query' => $rootQueryType
 ]));
 ```
 After:
 ```php
 $processor = new Processor((new Schema([
     'query' => $rootQueryType
 ]));
 ```

 Method `->processRequest($payload, $variables = [])` changed to `->processPayload(string $payload, $variables = [])`

### Field/Type definition
 Schema definition has changed so that `resolve` function is no longer exists inside `Type` and instead moved to where it belongs â€“ to the `Field` object that was introduced in `1.2`.
 Before:
 ```php
 $userType = new ObjectType([
    'name' => 'User',
    'fields' => [
        'id' => new IntType(),
        'name' => new StringType(),
    ],
    'resolve' => function($value, $args, $type) {
        return [
            'id' => 1,
            'name' => 'John'
        ];
    }
 ]);  

 ```
